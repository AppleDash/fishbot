See https://wiki.interlinked.me/page/Fishbot for a general list of commands.

To run your own, you'll need PHP and MySQL. Edit the config.example.php appropriately and rename it to config.php.
You'll also need to run a script to create the database (which I haven't made yet)
Then to run, use "php bot.php"

Visit #fishbot on irc.interlinked.me for questions and such.
